# cs50GO
This project is a mirror to Harvard's CS50 course, answering all psets in Go instead of C. A project just for my own understanding of Go and programming in general. 

#First Instructions for starting a Go Project: 
* install the latest stable version of Go, golang.org has the download and good installation instructions
* Go folder structure is into what is called a GOPATH, you can find out more about setting up your Go files here: https://golang.org/doc/code.html. You can also copy the file structure I use in this project. 
* Once you have your files set up, make a simple file in your src folder (like "hello.go") and put a very simple program in it (or copy my hello.go)
* In your terminal run: 
	go run hello.go (or whatever you named your file)
* If it returns your message, (or the simple hello world message if you use my example), you are good to go....pun intented?

Now that we have a good start with Go and a place to work, I will continue following the CS50 course assignments in Go. Assignments will probably have a similarly named .md file to go with them, explaining the assignment and lessons learned or interesting contrasts between the assignment as done in C and in Go.
