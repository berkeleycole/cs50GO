# cs50GO
Mirror to Harvard's CS50 course, with Go instead of C. A project just for my own understanding of Go.

#First Instructions for starting a Go Project: 
* install the latest stable version of Go, golang.org has the download and good installation instructions
* Most developers keep everything Go in one folder, and the Go folder is called a workspace, so make your go folder(mine is called gospace)
* Inside your workspace, the common organization is to have three folders. First, a bin folder for your executables, make a bin folder
* Second, a pkg folder will hold all your Go packages. Make a pkg folder
* And last, there will be a src folder for the files your write. Create a src folder
* Now that you have three folders, make a simple file in your src folder (like "hello.go") and put a very simple program in it (or copy my hello.go)
* In your terminal run: 
	go run hello.go (or whatever you named your file)
* If it returns what it is supposed to, in this case the simple hello world message, you are good to go....pun intented?


Now that we have a good start with Go and a place to work, I will continue following the CS50 course assignments in Go. Assignments will probably have a similarly named .md file to go with them, explaining the assignment and lessons learned or interesting contrasts between the assignment as done in C and in Go.
