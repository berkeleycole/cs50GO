##Assignment 5: The Vigenere Cypher

This assignment is almost identitical to the Ceasar cypher, but with an extra layer of trickyness. Instead of the key being an all-too-easily-decrypted number, the key is a word. One by one, each letter from the key word is added to a letter from the message, so that the effect is of multiple Ceasar cyphers all being used on the same message. Of course, this is not incredibly secure either - the lecture videos explain why - but the added for loop layers are what make it a code challenge.
